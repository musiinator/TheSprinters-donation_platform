# Change lives: A Donation Platform

## About Change lives

Change lives is a donation platform that aims to bring warmth and support to families in need. At its core, Change lives bridges the gap between generous donors and those requiring assistance, with trusted organizations playing a crucial role in the seamless distribution of goods. This web application is built on the premise that helping others should be straightforward and fulfilling, ensuring that every donation directly contributes to making a significant difference in someone's life.

## Mission

Our mission is to create a world where generosity flows unimpeded from those who wish to help to those who need it most. Through GoodConnect, we envision a community of support, mutual respect, and unwavering solidarity.

## How It Works

Change lives allows users to easily donate goods to verified organizations that then ensure these contributions reach the intended families. The process is designed to be as simple as possible for both donors and organizations, fostering an environment of trust and continuous giving.
